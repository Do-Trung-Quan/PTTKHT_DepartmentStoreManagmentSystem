An online department store management system could be used by management staff, sale staff, and customer:
● Management staff: view all kinds of statistics: imports, exports, customers and suppliers. Commodity information management. Import goods from suppliers, manage supplier information
● Sale staff: browse invoices online, pack and deliver to delivery staff
● Customer: register as a member, find and look up product information, order online, track invoice status.

Considering two modules and answering questions
● Customer registers as a member: selects the member registration menu → enters customer information, clicks add → the system saves to the database.
● Management staff imports goods from suppliers: selects the import menu → find suppliers by name (if not, add a new one) → Repeats the following steps for all imported goods: selects search for items by name (if not already available, then add new) → enters quantity + unit price → repeats until all the imported goods are finished, then submits → prints out the invoice
